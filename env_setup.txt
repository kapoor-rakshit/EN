EVENT Loop in NodeJs    (Refer Screenshot)



CALLBACKs
callbacks are used for async code execution.


MODULES
.. Builtin modules   (fs, http,   etc...)
.. Project modules   (user created)
.. Public  modules   (npm)

.. These are exported and used in another file
   var modulename = require('./module_to_be_exported')      // "require" is similar to import

. For Large files , read in chunks
.. "readable" and "end" are builtin for readstream

. For Syncronous file read ie till not read the file it will not go to next line
.. This is referred as blocking code execution
.. fs (FileSystem)
.. fs.readFileSync            // readFileSyncronously
.. fs.statSync                // stats of file like size, .... etc..

.     Asyncronous file read
.. fs.stat



PROCESS MODULE
.. process.pid
.. process.cwd()
.. process.version     .... etc ...



OS MODULE
.. os.hostname()
.. os.totalmem()
.. os.freemem()      ..... etc ....



HTTP SERVER


Server request using EXPRESS


.. Routing
... route files added under routes folder

.. Dynamic routing
... using PARAMS    /:id
... using QUERY     /?id=112&name=ra20024024                    // NOTE : use of ?

.. SET NODE_ENV="value"   in   windows
