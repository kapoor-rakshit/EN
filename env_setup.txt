NOTE :  AngularJS is for building CLIENT-side web applications
        NodeJs is used to build SERVER-side applications
        expressJs is a NodeJs framework to build websites / web services using principles and approaches of node.js.



EVENT Loop in NodeJs    (Refer Screenshot)



CALLBACKs
callbacks are used for async code execution.


MODULES
.. Builtin modules   (fs, http,   etc...)
.. Project modules   (user created)
.. Public  modules   (npm)

.. These are exported and used in another file
   var modulename = require('./module_to_be_exported')      // "require" is similar to import



EVENT EMITTER
.. Publisher emits EVENT and Subscriber subscribes for EVENT
.. Builtin EVENTEmitter
.. Project modules/User Created



STREAMS
Stream are instances of event emitter. These can be read, write, OR both
. For Small files read
.. "pipe" to other when read from another

. For Large files , read in chunks
.. "readable" and "end" are builtin for readstream

. For Syncronous file read ie untill not read the file it will not go to next line
.. This is referred as blocking code execution
.. fs (FileSystem)
.. fs.readFileSync            // readFileSyncronously
.. fs.statSync                // stats of file like size, .... etc..

.     Asyncronous file read : DEFAULT behaviour of node
.. fs.stat



PROCESS MODULE
.. process.pid
.. process.cwd()
.. process.version     .... etc ...



OS MODULE
.. os.hostname()
.. os.totalmem()
.. os.freemem()      ..... etc ....



HTTP SERVER
. Server request using NODE


. Server request using EXPRESS


.. Routing   (Refer Screenshots)
...  route files added under routes folder

.. Dynamic routing
...  using PARAMS    /:id
...  using QUERY     /?id=112&name=ra20024024                    // NOTE : use of ?

.. ENV CONFIG
...  variables inited during run for program to behave accordingly.
...  On windows : set CONFIG_VAR=development                        // set env variable , NOTE : no space , no "quotes" please :)
                  node filename.js                                  // run your file
